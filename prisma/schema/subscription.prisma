// SUBSCRIPTION MODELS
// =============================================================================

/// Represents a subscription to the platform's services.
/// A subscription can be associated with either an individual user or a team, but not both.
/// 
/// Subscription Features:
/// - Individual and team subscription types
/// - Multiple plan tiers with different access levels
/// - Integration with external payment providers (Stripe, Polar)
/// - Automatic enrollment management
/// - Billing period tracking for renewals
/// 
/// Business Logic:
/// - One subscription per user OR team (mutually exclusive)
/// - Subscription status synced with payment provider
/// - Enrollments are automatically granted/revoked based on status
/// - Teams can share subscriptions among members
/// 
/// Integration Notes:
/// - subscriptionId links to external payment provider
/// - Status values match payment provider conventions
/// - Billing periods determine access duration

/// - Links users to specific courses or programs

/// - Automatic enrollment/revocation based on subscription status
/// - Supports both individual and team-based access
/// 
/// Access Control Logic:
/// - Individual enrollments: User must have active subscription
/// - Team enrollments: User must be team member + team must have active subscription
/// - Enrollments are automatically created when subscription becomes active
/// - Enrollments are revoked when subscription expires/cancels
/// 
/// Business Rules:
/// - One enrollment per user per course/program
/// - Team enrollments override individual enrollments
/// - Enrollment date tracks when access was first granted
