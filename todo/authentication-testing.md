# Authentication Module Testing Plan

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Strategy for Authentication System

This document outlines a complete testing strategy for the authentication module, covering unit tests, integration tests, security testing, and end-to-end scenarios.

## üìã Testing Checklist

### üîß Setup & Infrastructure

- [ ] **Set up authentication test environment**
  - Configure test database with proper isolation
  - Set up mock providers for external services
  - Create test utilities and helper functions
  - Configure test-specific environment variables

### ‚öôÔ∏è Unit Tests

- [ ] **Test auth.server.ts utilities**

  - Session creation and validation logic
  - User lookup and authentication functions
  - Token generation and verification
  - Password hashing and comparison
  - Error handling for invalid inputs

- [ ] **Test provider utilities (github.server.ts)**

  - OAuth flow initiation and callback handling
  - User data extraction from provider responses
  - Error handling for provider failures
  - Token exchange and refresh mechanisms
  - User profile mapping and normalization

- [ ] **Test session.server.ts management**

  - Session storage and retrieval operations
  - Session expiration and cleanup
  - Session destruction and invalidation
  - Cookie handling and security settings
  - Concurrent session management

- [ ] **Test permissions.server.ts system**
  - Role-based access control validation
  - Permission checking for different user types
  - Resource-level authorization logic
  - Admin and user privilege separation
  - Permission inheritance and cascading

### üîó Integration Tests

- [ ] **Test complete sign-in flow**

  - OAuth redirect and callback handling
  - Session creation after successful authentication
  - User profile creation for new users
  - Redirect to intended destination after login
  - Error handling for failed authentication

- [ ] **Test user registration flow**

  - New user account creation process
  - Profile setup and onboarding steps
  - Email verification if implemented
  - Default role and permission assignment
  - Welcome email sending and tracking

- [ ] **Test sign-out flow**

  - Session destruction and cleanup
  - Cookie removal and invalidation
  - Redirect handling after logout
  - Multiple device/session logout
  - Security cleanup (token revocation)

- [ ] **Test protected routes middleware**

  - Authentication requirement enforcement
  - Unauthorized access handling and redirects
  - Role-based route protection
  - API endpoint authentication
  - Middleware performance and caching

- [ ] **Test password reset flow**

  - Reset token generation and expiration
  - Email sending and delivery tracking
  - Password update validation and security
  - Token invalidation after use
  - Rate limiting for reset requests

- [ ] **Test email change flow**

  - Email verification process
  - Notification emails to old and new addresses
  - Rollback scenarios for failed changes
  - Duplicate email prevention
  - Security notifications

- [ ] **Test profile management**
  - Profile photo upload and processing
  - Name and bio updates with validation
  - Account settings modifications
  - Data persistence and retrieval
  - Input sanitization and validation

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Edge Cases

- [ ] **Test security measures**

  - CSRF protection implementation
  - Session hijacking prevention
  - Rate limiting for authentication attempts
  - Brute force attack protection
  - Secure cookie configuration

- [ ] **Test error scenarios**
  - Network failure handling
  - Invalid token processing
  - Expired session management
  - Malformed request handling
  - Database connection failures

### ‚ö° Performance & E2E

- [ ] **Test performance scenarios**

  - Concurrent login handling
  - Session lookup optimization

  - Response time benchmarking

- [ ] **Test end-to-end user journeys**
  - Complete signup to profile management flow
  - Multi-device authentication scenarios
  - Account recovery processes
  - Permission changes and updates
  - Cross-browser compatibility

### üõ†Ô∏è Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] **Create comprehensive mocks**

  - GitHub OAuth service mocking
  - Email provider service mocking
  - File storage service mocking
  - Database operation mocking
  - External API dependency mocking

- [ ] **Create test data factories**

  - User entity factories with variations
  - Session data factories
  - Authentication token factories
  - Permission and role factories
  - Test scenario data generators

- [ ] **Analyze test coverage**

  - Identify gaps in current testing
  - Measure code coverage percentages
  - Review critical path coverage
  - Document untested edge cases
  - Plan additional test scenarios

- [ ] **Document testing patterns**
  - Authentication testing best practices
  - Test utility usage guidelines
  - Mock service configuration
  - Test data management strategies
  - Debugging and troubleshooting guides

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with setup** - Ensure test environment is properly configured
2. **Build core unit tests** - Test individual functions and utilities
3. **Add integration tests** - Test complete flows and interactions
4. **Implement security tests** - Verify protection mechanisms
5. **Create comprehensive mocks** - Ensure reliable test isolation
6. **Document patterns** - Share knowledge with the team

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Aim for 90%+ coverage on authentication code
- **Test Reliability**: All tests should pass consistently
- **Performance**: Authentication operations under 200ms
- **Security**: Zero security vulnerabilities in auth flow
