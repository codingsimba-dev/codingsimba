# TypeScript with React: Building Type-Safe Applications

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on using TypeScript with React! Learn how to build robust, type-safe React applications that catch errors at compile time and provide better developer experience.

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll master:

- **TypeScript Fundamentals**: Understanding types, interfaces, and generics
- **React with TypeScript**: Properly typing React components and props
- **State Management**: Typing useState, useReducer, and context
- **Event Handling**: Type-safe event handlers and form management
- **Advanced Patterns**: Generic components and utility types

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:

- Solid understanding of JavaScript (ES6+)
- Experience with React components and hooks
- Basic familiarity with TypeScript concepts

## Course Structure

This tutorial is structured into 1 comprehensive lesson:

1. **TypeScript + React Fundamentals** - Complete guide to building type-safe React applications

## Why TypeScript with React?

TypeScript provides several benefits when building React applications:

- **Catch errors early**: Identify issues at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better IDE support**: Enhanced autocomplete, refactoring, and navigation
- **Improved maintainability**: Self-documenting code with clear interfaces
- **Team collaboration**: Better code understanding and reduced bugs
- **Refactoring confidence**: Safe refactoring with type checking

## What You'll Build

Throughout this tutorial, you'll build a complete type-safe React application that demonstrates:

- Proper component typing
- State management with TypeScript
- API integration with typed responses
- Form handling with validation
- Advanced TypeScript patterns
